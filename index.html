Please take care that no injustice is done to her. <br> By the mid-nineteenth century, the armies of the British East India Company, a merchant corporation-turned political entity, had subjugated much of the Indian subcontinent;[17] Jhansi itself had been ceded to the Company in 1817.[18] By 1853, the Company administration, led by Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, had for several years enforced a "doctrine of lapse", wherein Indian states whose Hindu rulers died without a natural heir were annexed by Britain. This policy was quickly enforced on Jhansi after Gangadhar Rao's death, to the Rani's dismay.[19] She wrote a letter to the Company protesting against the annexation on 16 February 1854.[20] Dalhousie issued a lengthy minute in response eleven days later. He characterised Gangadhar Rao's rule as one of decline and mismanagement, asserted that Jhansi and its people would benefit from direct British rule, and argued that since the British had conquered the Marathas, Jhansi's former overlords, the Company was now the "paramount power" with the authority to decide the succession.</p>

                    <p class="mt-5 fw-bold shadow">Lakshmi Bai (born c. November 19, 1828?, Kashi, India—died June 17/18, 1858, Kotah-ki-Serai, near Gwalior) was the rani (queen) of Jhansi (now in Madhya Pradesh, India) and a leader of the Indian Rebellion of 1857–58.</p>
                    <h2 class="fw-bold shadow">Early life and marriage</h2>
                    <p>Manikarnika Tambe was born in Kashi (now Varanasi) in about 1827 or 1828 (the year of her birth is disputed, and some historians believe it was later than 1828, which is the commonly accepted year). She was brought up in the household of the peshwa (ruler) Baji Rao II, whom her father served as an adviser. Manikarnika had an unusual upbringing for a Brahmin girl. Growing up with the boys in the peshwa’s court, she was trained in martial arts and became proficient in sword fighting and riding. The peshwa’s sons, Nana Sahib and Rao Sahib, and nephew, Tantia Tope, trained with the young Manikarnika. They would later become prominent figures in the Indian Rebellion.
                    Manikarnika married Gangadhar Rao, the maharaja of the princely state (nominally ruled principalities subject to colonial oversight) of Jhansi, and took on the name of Lakshmi Bai. The date of the wedding is variously given as 1842 or 1852. As queen, she is believed to have challenged the social norms of the time that regulated the behavior of women. She refused to conform to the purdah (veil) system, which required women to be obscured from public gaze, and continued her martial practice. In 1852 Lakshmi Bai bore a son, who died in infancy, and she was widowed soon after without bearing a surviving heir to the throne.</p>
                    <h2 class="fw-bold shadow">The annexation of Jhansi</h2>
                    <p>Following established Hindu tradition, just before his death, the maharaja had adopted a boy as his heir, a 5-year-old male relative who was renamed Damodar Rao. However, Lord Dalhousie, the British governor-general of India, refused to recognize the adopted heir in accordance with the doctrine of lapse, by which the British annexed princely states where the ruler had died without a natural heir. Jhansi was accordingly annexed in 1854, and Lakshmi Bai’s petition to be recognized as regent was rejected. An agent of the East India Company, which acted as the agent of British imperialism in India during this time, was posted in the small kingdom to look after administrative matters.</p>

One often-copied portrait (see top of article) originally depicted her riding a horse sidesaddle, but the lower half of the painting, found in a family home in Indore, has decayed. The other major depiction (see #Early life and marriage) is less immediately recognisable as the Rani, as it only depicts her head adorned with a sari and jewellery. Under British rule, the production of these and later paintings served as covert political commentary.[136] Numerous statues of the Rani have also been created, most portray her escape on horseback with Damodar Rao on her back, although the bronze statue on her cremation site at Gwalior depicts her alone. <br>In 1953, Sohrab Modi directed India's first Technicolor film, titled Jhansi Ki Rani and starring the actress Mehtab in the title role. The Rani is depicted as a revolutionary, nationalist leader from childhood, albeit one guided by a fictional male advisor. In the wake of the traumatic events of India's partition, the film includes political commentary by depicting a prominent Muslim subject as reverential towards Hindu rulers and faiths, a portrayal deliberately at odds with contemporary Islamic attitudes in India.[138] The film ends by depicting the Rani, dying in battle, whispering her last words to the echo of the Indian national anthem, evoking an explicit connection between historical nationalism and modern independence. <br>Twenty-first-century depictions of Rani Lakshmibai include a television serial, Ek Veer Stree Ki Kahaani – Jhansi Ki Rani, which aired between 2009 and 2011, and the 2019 film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi. Manikarnika met with protests before release, because of rumours it was based on a 2007 novel by Jaishree Misra which was banned in Uttar Pradesh because it depicted a romance between the Rani and a British officer.[140] The film in reality contained no such story; directed by and starring Kangana Ranaut, it continued the traditional nationalist portrayal by depicting the Rani ripping the Union Jack with her sword and expertly fighting in battle.
