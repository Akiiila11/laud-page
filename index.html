                            <p class="card-text"> The Rani of Jhansi (born Manikarnika Tambe; 1828 or 1835 – 18 June 1858), also known as Rani Lakshmibai, was one of the leading figures of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The queen consort of the princely state of Jhansi from 1843 to 1853, she assumed its leadership after the outbreak of conflict and fought several battles against the British. Her life and deeds are celebrated in modern India and she remains a potent symbol of Indian nationalism. <br><br> Born into a Marathi family in Varanasi, Manikarnika Tambe was married to the raja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao, at a young age, taking the name Rani Lakshmibai. The couple had one son but he died young, and so when Gangadhar Rao was on his deathbed in 1853, he adopted Damodar Rao, a young relative, to be his successor. <br><br> The British East India Company, the overlord of Jhansi, refused to recognise this succession and annexed Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse, ignoring the Rani's vigorous protests to the Governor-General Lord Dalhousie. <br><br> In May 1857, the Indian troops stationed at Jhansi mutinied and massacred most of the British in the town; the Rani's complicity and participation in these events was and remains contested. She took over rulership of Jhansi and recruited an army to see off incursions from neighbouring states. Although her relations with the British were initially neutral, they decided to treat her as an enemy: Major General Hugh Rose attacked and captured Jhansi in March and April 1858. The Rani escaped the siege on horseback and joined other rebel leaders at Kalpi, where Rose defeated them on 22 May. The rebels fled to Gwalior Fort, where they made their last stand; the Rani died there in battle. <br><br> After the rebellion, the Rani's name and actions became closely associated with nationalist movements in India. Her legend, influenced by Hindu mythology, became hugely influential because of its universal applicability. She was regarded as a great heroine by the Indian independence movement and remains revered in modern India, although Dalit communities tend to view her negatively. Rani Lakshmibai has been extensively depicted in artwork, cinema, and literature, most notably in the 1930 poem "Jhansi Ki Rani" and Vrindavan Lal Verma's 1946 novel Jhansi ki Rani Lakshmi Bai.  God willing I still hope to recover and regain my health. I am not too old, so I may still father children. In case that happens, I will take the proper measures concerning my adopted son. But if I fail to live, please take my previous loyalty into account and show kindness to my son. <br> <br>Please acknowledge my widow as the mother of this boy during her lifetime. May the government approve of her as the queen and ruler of this kingdom as long as the boy is still under age. Please take care that no injustice is done to her. <br><br> By the mid-nineteenth century, the armies of the British East India Company, a merchant corporation-turned political entity, had subjugated much of the Indian subcontinent; Jhansi itself had been ceded to the Company in 1817. <br> <br> By 1853, the Company administration, led by Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, had for several years enforced a "doctrine of lapse", wherein Indian states whose Hindu rulers died without a natural heir were annexed by Britain. <br><br> This policy was quickly enforced on Jhansi after Gangadhar Rao's death, to the Rani's dismay. She wrote a letter to the Company protesting against the annexation on 16 February 1854. Dalhousie issued a lengthy minute in response eleven days later. <br> <br> He characterised Gangadhar Rao's rule as one of decline and mismanagement, asserted that Jhansi and its people would benefit from direct British rule, and argued that since the British had conquered the Marathas, Jhansi's former overlords, <br>the Company was now the <strong>"paramount power"</strong>  with the authority to decide the succession. </p>

                    <p class="mt-5 fw-bold shadow">Lakshmi Bai (born c. November 19, 1828?, Kashi, India—died June 17/18, 1858, Kotah-ki-Serai, near Gwalior) was the rani (queen) of Jhansi (now in Madhya Pradesh, India) and a leader of the Indian Rebellion of 1857–58.</p>
                    <h2 class="fw-bold shadow">Early life and marriage</h2>
                    <p>Manikarnika Tambe was born in Kashi (now Varanasi) in about 1827 or 1828 (the year of her birth is disputed, and some historians believe it was later than 1828, which is the commonly accepted year). She was brought up in the household of the peshwa (ruler) Baji Rao II, whom her father served as an adviser. Manikarnika had an unusual upbringing for a Brahmin girl. Growing up with the boys in the peshwa’s court, she was trained in martial arts and became proficient in sword fighting and riding. The peshwa’s sons, Nana Sahib and Rao Sahib, and nephew, Tantia Tope, trained with the young Manikarnika. They would later become prominent figures in the Indian Rebellion.
                    Manikarnika married Gangadhar Rao, the maharaja of the princely state (nominally ruled principalities subject to colonial oversight) of Jhansi, and took on the name of Lakshmi Bai. The date of the wedding is variously given as 1842 or 1852. As queen, she is believed to have challenged the social norms of the time that regulated the behavior of women. She refused to conform to the purdah (veil) system, which required women to be obscured from public gaze, and continued her martial practice. In 1852 Lakshmi Bai bore a son, who died in infancy, and she was widowed soon after without bearing a surviving heir to the throne.</p>
                    <h2 class="fw-bold shadow">The annexation of Jhansi</h2>
                    <p>Following established Hindu tradition, just before his death, the maharaja had adopted a boy as his heir, a 5-year-old male relative who was renamed Damodar Rao. However, Lord Dalhousie, the British governor-general of India, refused to recognize the adopted heir in accordance with the doctrine of lapse, by which the British annexed princely states where the ruler had died without a natural heir. Jhansi was accordingly annexed in 1854, and Lakshmi Bai’s petition to be recognized as regent was rejected. An agent of the East India Company, which acted as the agent of British imperialism in India during this time, was posted in the small kingdom to look after administrative matters.</p>

One often-copied portrait (see top of article) originally depicted her riding a horse sidesaddle, but the lower half of the painting, found in a family home in Indore, has decayed. The other major depiction (see #Early life and marriage) is less immediately recognisable as the Rani, as it only depicts her head adorned with a sari and jewellery. Under British rule, the production of these and later paintings served as covert political commentary.[136] Numerous statues of the Rani have also been created, most portray her escape on horseback with Damodar Rao on her back, although the bronze statue on her cremation site at Gwalior depicts her alone. <br>In 1953, Sohrab Modi directed India's first Technicolor film, titled Jhansi Ki Rani and starring the actress Mehtab in the title role. The Rani is depicted as a revolutionary, nationalist leader from childhood, albeit one guided by a fictional male advisor. In the wake of the traumatic events of India's partition, the film includes political commentary by depicting a prominent Muslim subject as reverential towards Hindu rulers and faiths, a portrayal deliberately at odds with contemporary Islamic attitudes in India.[138] The film ends by depicting the Rani, dying in battle, whispering her last words to the echo of the Indian national anthem, evoking an explicit connection between historical nationalism and modern independence. <br>Twenty-first-century depictions of Rani Lakshmibai include a television serial, Ek Veer Stree Ki Kahaani – Jhansi Ki Rani, which aired between 2009 and 2011, and the 2019 film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi. Manikarnika met with protests before release, because of rumours it was based on a 2007 novel by Jaishree Misra which was banned in Uttar Pradesh because it depicted a romance between the Rani and a British officer.[140] The film in reality contained no such story; directed by and starring Kangana Ranaut, it continued the traditional nationalist portrayal by depicting the Rani ripping the Union Jack with her sword and expertly fighting in battle.
