                            <p class="card-text"> The Rani of Jhansi (born Manikarnika Tambe; 1828 or 1835 – 18 June 1858), also known as Rani Lakshmibai, was
                            one of the leading figures of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The queen consort of the princely state of Jhansi from 1843 to 1853,
                            she assumed its leadership after the outbreak of conflict and fought several battles against the British. Her life and deeds 
                            are celebrated in modern India and she remains a potent symbol of Indian nationalism. <br><br> Born into a Marathi family in
                            Varanasi, Manikarnika Tambe was married to the raja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao, at a young age, taking the name Rani Lakshmibai.
                            The couple had one son but he died young, and so when Gangadhar Rao was on his deathbed in 1853, he adopted Damodar Rao,
                            a young relative, to be his successor. <br><br>  In May 1857, the Indian troops stationed at Jhansi mutinied and massacred 
                            most of the British in the town; the Rani's complicity and participation in these events was and remains contested. 
                            She took over rulership of Jhansi and recruited an army to see off incursions from neighbouring states. Although her
                            relations with the British were initially neutral, Major General Hugh Rose attacked
                            and captured Jhansi in March and April 1858. 
                            Rani Lakshmibai has been extensively depicted in artwork, cinema, and literature, most notably in the 1930 poem 
                            "Jhansi Ki Rani" and Vrindavan Lal Verma's 1946 novel Jhansi ki Rani Lakshmi Bai.  God willing I still hope to recover 
                            and regain my health. I am not too old, so I may still father children. In case that happens, I will take the proper
                            measures concerning my adopted son. But if I fail to live, please take my previous loyalty into account and show kindness 
                            to my son.  <br> <br> He characterised Gangadhar Rao's rule as one of decline and mismanagement, 
                            asserted that Jhansi and its people would benefit from direct British rule, and argued that since the British had
                            conquered the Marathas, Jhansi's former overlords, <br>the Company was now the <strong>"paramount power"</strong>  
                            with the authority to decide the succession. </p>

                    near Gwalior) was the rani (queen) of Jhansi (now in Madhya Pradesh, India) and a leader of the Indian Rebellion of 
                    1857–58.</p>
                    <h2 class="fw-bold shadow">Early life and marriage</h2>
                    <p>Manikarnika Tambe was born in Kashi (now Varanasi) in about 1827 or 1828 (the year of her birth is disputed, and some
                    historians believe it was later than 1828, which is the commonly accepted year). She was brought up in the household 
                    of the peshwa (ruler) Baji Rao II, whom her father served as an adviser. 
                    Manikarnika married Gangadhar Rao, the maharaja of the princely state (nominally ruled principalities subject to colonial
                    oversight) of Jhansi, and took on the name of Lakshmi Bai.  
                    after without bearing a surviving heir to the throne.</p>
                    <h2 class="fw-bold shadow">The annexation of Jhansi</h2>
                    <p>Following established Hindu tradition, just before his death, the maharaja had adopted a boy as his heir, a 5-year-old
                    male relative who was renamed Damodar Rao. However, Lord Dalhousie, the British governor-general of India, refused to 
                    recognize the adopted heir in accordance with the doctrine of lapse, by which the British annexed princely states where
                    the ruler had died without a natural heir. Jhansi was accordingly annexed in 1854, and Lakshmi Bai’s petition to be
                    recognized as regent was rejected. An agent of the East India Company, which acted as the agent of British imperialism
                    in India during this time, was posted in the small kingdom to look after administrative matters.</p>

                            (see top of article) originally depicted her riding a horse sidesaddle, but the lower half of the painting, 
                            found in a family home in Indore, has decayed. The other major depiction (see #Early life and marriage) is 
                            less immediately recognisable as the Rani, as it only depicts her head adorned with a sari and jewellery. 
                            Under British rule, the production of these and later paintings served as covert political commentary.
                            Numerous statues of the Rani have also been created, most portray her escape on horseback with Damodar Rao 
                            on her back, although the bronze statue on her cremation site at Gwalior depicts her alone. 
                            <p>In 1953,
                            Sohrab Modi directed India's first Technicolor film, titled Jhansi Ki Rani and starring the actress Mehtab
                            in the title role. The Rani is depicted as a revolutionary, nationalist leader from childhood, albeit one
                            guided by a fictional male advisor. In the wake of the traumatic events of India's partition, the film 
                            includes political commentary by depicting a prominent Muslim subject as reverential towards Hindu rulers
                            and faiths, a portrayal deliberately at odds with contemporary Islamic attitudes in India.</p>
